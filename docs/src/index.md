    title: What is NeuralQuantumStates.jl?
    details: NeuralQuantumStates.jl is a Julia package under development to facilitate the training of neural quantum states (NQS) by variational Monte Carlo (VMC). The package aims to provide an efficient and extensible environment for the simulation of closed many-body quantum systems by exploiting the power of neural networks and modern computational resources.
